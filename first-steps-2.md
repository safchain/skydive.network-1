<p>For this second part we will introduce the traffic capture capabilities of Skydive.</p>
<h2>First capture</h2>
<p>
  Even if Skydive come with a Rest API and a client allowing us to create captures we will use the WebUI as it is the easiest way to start playing
  with traffic captures. The following tiny video shows how to start a simple capture with default options on an interface.

  <video id="nsc_stream_video" poster="" preload="" controls="" autoplay="" loop="" controlslist="nodownload" src="assets/videos/first-steps/capture-1.webm"></video>
<p>

<p>
  Once the capture is started the interface captured get a `red point` marking that the capture is active. Then you can go to the right panel and click on the
  flow refresh button to see active flows.
</p>

<p>
  To get more details about flow a simple click on it will display them. We won't detail here all the fields as it will
  the subject of another part but TrackingID and L3TrackingID are constant ID for a flow across multiple interfaces while UUID is the ID for the flow at this
  specific point of capture.
</p>

<p>
  As showed in the following video there are ways to filter, sort flows or select specific fields that will be displayed.
